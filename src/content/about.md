## About Me

I’m a senior computer science major at the University of Houston focused on building full-stack applications and tools that integrate directly into everyday workflows. My work spans web development, portable high-performance web applications, database-backed systems, machine learning, and data analysis.

Projects are built primarily with C, C++, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, SQL, and Rust, using technologies such as React, Node.js, WebAssembly, and browser APIs. I also work on audio software and digital signal processing, game development, and contributing to open-source software.
